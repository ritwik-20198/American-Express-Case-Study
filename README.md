## How American Express uses Big Data in practice 🛠️
Data analytics, and specifically machine learning, is at the heart of American Express’s decision making. Two areas where this is evident are detecting fraud, and bringing merchants and customers closer together.

Credit card fraud detection and prevention now relies heavily on machine learning algorithms. AmEx’s goal is to detect fraudulent transactions as quickly as possible to minimize loss, so they employ a machine learning model that uses a variety of data sources, including card membership information, spending details, and merchant information to detect suspicious events, and make a decision in milliseconds by comparing that event to a large dataset.
